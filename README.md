#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.
it has enhanced business growth through digital transformation
Improves security of systems through maintenance and testing
Enhances innovation and technological advancements through creation of applications eg mobile apps


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
(i)NATO Software Engineering Conference-conference introduced the term "Software Engineering" and emphasized structured design, documentation, and best practices in software development.
                                         this milestone formalized software development as an engineering discipline rather than just programming.
(ii) Agile Manifesto- traditional Waterfall development was proving too rigid for rapidly changing business environments.software developers created the Agile Manifesto, emphasizing:
                      Customer collaboration over contract negotiation, Working software over comprehensive documentation, Responding to change over following a fixed plan, Individuals 
                      and interactions over processes and tools

(iii)The Rise of DevOps Practices-the demand for continuous integration, deployment, and monitoring led to the rise of DevOps, promotes automation, collaboration and continuous 
                                  integration or continuous deployment to streamline software delivery
                                  
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
(i)Planning- in this phase  project requirements, feasibility, and scope are assessed.
(ii)Requirement anlysis- in this phase we define define functional and non-functional requirements.
(iii)Design-in this phase system architecture and software design are planned, frameworks and database structures are selected.
(iv)Implementation-in this phase the developers start coding
(v)Testing- in this phase software is tested for errors and bugs
(vi)Deployment- in this phase the software is released to users
(vii)Maintenance-in this phase ongoing maintenance ensures the software remains functional and updated.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-In the waterfall methodology projects are executed in a linear way while in agile projects are executed in an interactive incremental way
-in the waterfall  methodology project followes defined phases which are design, impelemtation, testing, deployment and maintenance while in the agile projects go through a continous cycle of planning, deployment, testing and feedback to achieve customer satisfaction
-in the waterfall methodology the product is delivered at the end of the project while in the agile methodoloy the finall product is deliverd in incremental bits.

example of waterfall project eg building a car for a client ...we design it then start building it when its done we will deliver the final product to the client. who is going to see the product for the first time
while an agile project eg building a car .... We will involve the client in a regular basis we can start  with the minimum viable product that allows us to test our idea and for him to try it and based on his feedback we can improve it and add new functionalities 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
(a)Software developer- designs, writes code and tests and fix bugs also collaborates with the team
(b)Quality assurance engineer- ensures that the  project meets the required standards, they create and maintain test automation 
   frameworks, they review codes, come up with ways to test the codes, monitor the execution of the project.
(c)Project manager-oversees the project ensuring it meets business goals and objrctives within time and budget, ensures the projects 
  documentation and reports through every phase are well maintained, creates project schedules, identifies risks and ways to solve 
  them,coordinates communication between developing team and the stakeholders of the project. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
(i)IDEs-Allows programmers to edit codes, has in built debuggers that help fix errors in a code, allows developers to compile and run programs easily
       _ eg Visual studio , Xcode, pycharm
(ii)VCS-Enforces discipline in a programmer, allows archive versions and maintains the information of the versions, allows recovery from deletions or edits, conserve disk space on serves.
       -eg Git, Mercurial, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
(i)Identifying and fixing bugs can be overcomed by team collaboration to detect errors early and come up with a solution faster and also Use debugging tools to analyze errors.
(ii)Keeping up with technological changes which include new frameworks, programming languages and tools can be overcomed by attending conferences, webinars, and workshops, also by 
  collaborating in projects, continuous learning through online courses, 
(iii)Balancing multiple tasks and meeting deadlines can be overcomed by using prioritizing tasks techniques, also using project management tools to track tasks and deadlines
(iv)Conflict between team members can be overcomed through having meetings to talk and engage with each other about the  project.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
(i)Unit testing: unit testing- tests each module and ensures they work as expected and fixes bugs.
(ii)Integration testing:top-down-tests high-level modules first, then integrate lower-level ones
                       bottom-up-start testing from lower-level modules and integrate upwards
                       big bang-tests all modules together at once
        
(iii)System testing:performance testing-checks system speed and responsiveness
                   security testing-ensures data protection against threats
                   usability testing- evaluates ease of use for end users

(iv)Acceptance testing:alpha testing-conducted in a controlled environment before release
                       beta testing-performed by real users in a real-world setting before final launch


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the practise of designing and refining inputs to effectively communicate with AI models to generate accurate, relevant and high quality responses.
importance-enhance Ai response quality, reduce misinterpretation by AI and optimize efficiency.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt- write about climate change
accurate prompt- Explain the main causes of climate change and their impact on global weather patterns. Include scientific data and recent examples from the past ten years
why its efficient-its more specific, guided and time frame included this help the AI give the best response to meet user requirement.
